    "description": "Cloud and Mist Tea, or Yun Wu in Mandarin, is harvested at high altitudes on Huaguo Mountain where the fog is thick, keeping the tea bushes hydrated and protected from the sun rays. Once processed, Yun Wu tends to have characteristically irregular twisted leaves, however, it has also been seen rolled up into small pellets or spiral shapes. Its unique growing conditions yield a layered cup with fruity notes and a very light smokiness.",
