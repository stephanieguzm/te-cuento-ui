  "description": "This wulong strikes us as a bridge between roasted and green oolongs as it retains some floral notes, while the light roasting enhances the honey nuance. Tightly rolled Anxi grown leaf with a light roasting offers a cup that is soft with sweet honey-floral notes and a delicate flinty minerality. Nicely layered without being too overt.",
